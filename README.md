# Interviews (practical) questions and code samples..
### The major point is not to ask puzzles like: you have "you have an array with 100 cells.." but more practical questions like "What is an OOP interface", "What is the diff between `var` and `let` (JS)" and so on.. 

Here following languages have things in progress now:

* [JavaScript](js/)
* PHP (soon)
* HTML/CSS (soon)
* Databases (soon)
* Linux for web (soon)

#### New suggestions for good practical questions can send via a pull request.
#### Enjoy!, s.
