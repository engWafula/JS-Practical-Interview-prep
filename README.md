# Practical JS Interview Questions

During the time i'm aggregating more and more daily-basis questions for web-development interviews.
It's mostly practical stuff i'm facing with during designing and developing systems and i found out 
that people covered it, are fits my needs :) 

## Low level coding stuff
        
* [Basic](code/src/basic.js)
* [Functions](code/src/functions.js)
* [Conditions](code/src/conditions.js)
* [Error Handling](code/src/errors.js)
* [Async coding](code/src/async.js)
* [Performance](code/src/performance.js)

## Theoretical stuff

* [Architecture](exams/architecture/README.MD)

## Home tasks

* [Frontend](exams/frontend/README.md)
* [Fullstack](exams/fullstack/README.md)

_Good luck!_
